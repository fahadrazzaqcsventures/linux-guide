# How does internet works?

1. **The Internet = a global network of networks**

    The Internet is basically millions of computers and devices connected together around the world, communicating through standardized rules called protocols (mainly TCP/IP).

2. **How data moves (in packets)**

    When you send a message, open a website, or stream a video:
    * Your data is broken into small chunks called packets.
    * Each packet is labeled with:
        * __Source address__ (your device’s IP)
        * __Destination address__ (the server’s IP)
    * These packets travel independently across routers and networks until they reach the destination.
    * The destination reassembles the packets into the original message.

3. **Your device connects through an ISP**

    * Your phone or computer connects to a router (Wi-Fi or cable).
    * The router connects to your Internet Service Provider (ISP) — like PTCL, StormFiber, or Nayatel in Pakistan.
    * The ISP sends your data onto the backbone of the Internet, which is a global system of high-speed fiber-optic cables.
  
4. **DNS – the Internet’s “phonebook”**

    * When you type a website like `www.google.com`, your computer:
    * Asks a DNS server to find the corresponding IP address (like 142.250.190.78).
    * Then it connects to that IP address to reach Google’s servers.
  
5. **Client–Server model**

    Most of the Internet works using this model:

    * __Client__: your browser or app (makes a request)
    * __Server__: a powerful computer that hosts data or applications (sends back a response)

    __Example:__

    You → request `www.youtube.com` → DNS resolves IP → your browser connects → YouTube’s server sends HTML, CSS, video, etc.

6. **Security and HTTPS**

    Modern sites use HTTPS (HTTP + SSL/TLS) — it encrypts data between you and the server, protecting it from snooping or tampering.

7. **Protocols make it all work**

    Some key Internet protocols:
    * HTTP/HTTPS – web traffic
    * FTP/SFTP – file transfer
    * SMTP/IMAP – email
    * SSH – secure remote access
    * TCP/IP – foundation of all communication
