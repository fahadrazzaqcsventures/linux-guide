# What is a Server?

A **server** is simply a **computer or program** that **provides services or resources** to other computers — called **clients** — over a **network** (like the Internet or a local network).

## 1. Basic Idea

- A **client** sends a **request** (for example, your browser asking for a web page).  
- A **server** listens, processes that request, and sends back a **response** (like the HTML page).  

This is called the **client-server model** — it’s how most of the Internet works.

**Example:**

Client (Browser) → "GET /index.html" → Web Server → sends → index.html

## 2. Types of Servers

| Server Type | Purpose | Example Software |
|--------------|----------|------------------|
| **Web Server** | Serves web pages | NGINX, Apache |
| **Application Server** | Runs backend app logic | Node.js, Django, Spring Boot |
| **Database Server** | Stores & retrieves data | MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB |
| **File Server** | Stores and shares files | Samba, NFS |
| **DNS Server** | Resolves domain names | BIND, Route53 |
| **Mail Server** | Handles emails | Postfix, Exim |
| **Proxy / Load Balancer** | Distributes or filters traffic | HAProxy, NGINX, AWS ELB |

## 3. Physical vs Virtual Servers

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|--------------|----------|
| **Physical Server** | A real machine in a data center | Dell PowerEdge, HP ProLiant |
| **Virtual Server (VM)** | A software-based server running inside a physical one | AWS EC2, Azure VM |
| **Containerized Server** | Lightweight, portable server environment | Docker container running NGINX |

In modern DevOps, most servers are **virtual** or **containerized** — they’re created and destroyed dynamically using **cloud platforms** or **Kubernetes**.

## 4. Server Characteristics

- **Always on** (or highly available)  
- **Listens on specific ports** (e.g., 80 for HTTP, 443 for HTTPS)  
- **Configured for performance & security**  
- **Can handle multiple client requests simultaneously**

## 5. From a DevOps Perspective

As a DevOps engineer, your job often involves:

- **Setting up servers** (on AWS, Azure, GCP, or bare metal)  
- **Configuring services** (web, app, DB servers)  
- **Automating provisioning** (using Terraform, Ansible, or CloudFormation)  
- **Monitoring & scaling** servers  
- **Securing** them with firewalls, IAM, and encryption  

## Example: A Simple Web Server Setup

User → Browser → Internet → NGINX Web Server → Node.js App → Database

Here:

- **NGINX** acts as the **web/reverse proxy server**.  
- **Node.js** acts as the **application server**.  
- **PostgreSQL** is the **database server**.

## In Short

> A **server** is a machine (physical or virtual) that **listens for requests**, **processes them**, and **returns responses** — forming the backbone of all online services.
