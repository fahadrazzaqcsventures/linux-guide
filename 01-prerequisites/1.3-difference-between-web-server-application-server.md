# Difference between web server & application server?

## Web Server

- **Purpose:** Handles **HTTP requests** from clients (browsers) and serves **static content** — like HTML, CSS, JS, and images.  
- **Examples:** **NGINX**, **Apache**, **Caddy**  
- **Key Role:**  
  - Accepts requests on port 80/443  
  - Delivers static files quickly  
  - Can forward (reverse proxy) dynamic requests to an application server  

**Think:** “Serves static files and routes traffic.”

## Application Server

- **Purpose:** Runs the **backend application logic** — processes data, connects to databases, and generates dynamic responses.  
- **Examples:** **Node.js**, **Django**, **Spring Boot**, **Flask**  
- **Key Role:**  
  - Executes business logic  
  - Interacts with databases  
  - Returns dynamic content (JSON, HTML templates, etc.)

**Think:** “Runs your app’s code and logic.”

## How They Work Together

Browser → Web Server (NGINX) → Application Server (Node.js / Flask) → Database

- The **web server** manages incoming requests and serves static files.  
- The **application server** handles the app logic and returns dynamic responses.

## In Short

> **Web Server = Serves static files + routes requests**  
> **Application Server = Runs backend logic + generates dynamic content**
