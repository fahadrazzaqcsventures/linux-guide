# What are standalone applications?

A **standalone application** is a **self-contained program** that runs **entirely on a single computer** — it does **not require a network connection or external server** to function.

## Key Characteristics

- Installed **locally** on the user’s system.  
- Runs **independently** — all logic, data, and processing happen on the same machine.  
- **No Internet or backend server** required to operate.  
- Often stores data **locally** (e.g., on disk or a local database).

## Examples

| **MS Paint / Photoshop** | Edits images using local processing. |
| **Calculator / Notepad** | Basic desktop tools that don’t rely on servers. |
| **VS Code (Offline Mode)** | Runs and edits files without network dependency. |
