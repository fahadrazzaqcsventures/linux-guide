# What is application support?

**Application Support** refers to the **ongoing maintenance, monitoring, and troubleshooting** of software applications after they are deployed and in use.  
The goal is to **ensure the application runs smoothly**, stays **available**, and meets **user needs** without interruptions.

## Key Responsibilities

- Monitor application performance and uptime.  
- Troubleshoot bugs, errors, or crashes.  
- Manage incidents and service requests.  
- Apply patches, updates, or configuration changes.  
- Coordinate with development teams for issue resolution.  
- Provide technical assistance to end users or customers.

## Example

A support engineer ensures that a company’s web app (e.g., an e-commerce site) is running 24/7, fixing errors like *“server not responding”* or *“database connection failed.”*

## In Short

> **Application Support** is about keeping applications **running efficiently and reliably**, by handling issues, updates, and user support after deployment.
