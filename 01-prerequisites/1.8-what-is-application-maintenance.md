# What is application maintenance?

**Application Maintenance** is the **process of updating, modifying, and improving software applications** after deployment to ensure they remain **functional, secure, and efficient** over time.

It goes beyond fixing issues — it involves **enhancing performance**, **adding new features**, and **adapting to changing business or technology needs**.

## Key Activities

- Fix bugs and errors.  
- Update libraries, dependencies, or frameworks.  
- Enhance performance and security.  
- Add new features or improve existing ones.  
- Adapt the application to new hardware or OS environments.  
- Perform preventive maintenance to avoid future issues.

## Example

A team updates a company’s payroll application to:

- Support a new tax rule.  
- Improve speed.  
- Fix reported calculation bugs.

## In Short

> **Application Maintenance** ensures that a software application stays **reliable, secure, and up to date** through continuous improvements and fixes after deployment.
