# Why Linux Over Windows

## 1. Open Source & Free

- **Linux** is completely **free and open source** — anyone can download, use, and modify it.  
- **Windows** requires **licenses** and has **closed-source code**.

## 2. Stability & Reliability

- Linux is known for its **stability and uptime** — many servers run for **years without rebooting**.  
- Windows often needs restarts after updates or may crash under heavy load.

## 3. Performance & Resource Usage

- **Linux** is **lightweight** and uses fewer system resources (CPU, RAM).  
- Ideal for **servers, containers, and virtual machines** where performance matters.  
- **Windows** is heavier and consumes more system resources.

## 4. Security

- Linux has **built-in permissions and user roles**, making it **less vulnerable to viruses and malware**.  
- Frequent updates and strong community oversight keep it secure.  
- Windows is more targeted by attackers due to its widespread desktop use.

## 5. Command-Line Power

- Linux terminal (Bash) is **powerful for automation, scripting, and DevOps tasks**.  
- Most **DevOps tools** (Docker, Kubernetes, Git, Ansible) are **built for Linux first**.  
- Windows CLI tools (PowerShell, WSL) are improving but still less native for DevOps workflows.

## 6. Server & Cloud Dominance

- Over **90% of servers and cloud infrastructure** (AWS, Azure, GCP) run on **Linux**.  
- Containers and orchestration platforms like **Docker** and **Kubernetes** are **Linux-based**.

## 7. Flexibility & Customization

- Linux can be **tuned for any environment** — desktop, embedded systems, IoT, or enterprise servers.  
- Windows is more restricted within Microsoft’s ecosystem.

## In Short

> **Linux** is preferred for **servers, DevOps, and cloud environments** because it’s **free, stable, secure, lightweight, customizable**, and **designed for automation and scalability** — all essential for modern infrastructure.
