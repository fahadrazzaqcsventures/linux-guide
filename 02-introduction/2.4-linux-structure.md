# Linux Structure (Architecture)

## Overview

The **Linux Operating System** is made up of **five main layers** — each plays a key role in how the system runs and interacts with hardware and software.

## 1. Hardware Layer

- This is the **base layer** of any computer system.  
- Includes all physical devices: CPU, RAM, hard drives, network cards, etc.  
- The **Kernel** communicates directly with this layer.

## 2. Kernel

- The **core part** of Linux — acts as a **bridge between hardware and software**.  
- Manages system resources like CPU, memory, devices, and processes.  
- Handles tasks such as:
  - Process management  
  - Memory management  
  - Device management  
  - System calls and I/O operations  

> Think of the **Kernel** as the **brain** of Linux.

## 3. System Libraries

- **Collections of pre-written functions** that programs use to interact with the Kernel.  
- Prevent applications from dealing with complex hardware instructions directly.  
- Example: **glibc (GNU C Library)** — helps programs make system calls to the kernel.

## 4. System Utilities
- Small programs that **perform basic system tasks** like managing files, processes, and users.  
- Examples:
  - `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `rm` → File operations  
  - `ps`, `top`, `kill` → Process management  
  - `useradd`, `passwd` → User management

## 5. User Interface (Shell)

- The **interface between user and system**.  
- Accepts commands and passes them to the kernel via the shell.  
- Two main types:
  - **CLI (Command-Line Interface):** Bash, Zsh  
  - **GUI (Graphical User Interface):** GNOME, KDE

| Shell (Bash, Zsh, Fish, etc.)                     |  <-- Part of the OS
+----------------------------------------------------+
| System Libraries (glibc, libc, OpenSSL, etc.)     |  <-- Part of the OS
+----------------------------------------------------+
| System Utilities (ls, grep, systemctl, etc.)      |  <-- Part of the OS
+----------------------------------------------------+
| Linux Kernel (Process, Memory, FS, Network)       |  <-- Core of the OS
+----------------------------------------------------+
| Hardware (CPU, RAM, Disk, Network, Peripherals)   |

## In Short

> The **Linux structure** consists of **Hardware → Kernel → System Libraries → Utilities → User Interface** — all working together to provide a stable and flexible operating system.
