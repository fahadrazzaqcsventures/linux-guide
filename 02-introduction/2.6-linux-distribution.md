# Linux Distributions (Distros)

A **Linux Distribution (or Distro)** is a **complete operating system** built around the **Linux kernel**, combined with:

- System libraries  
- Software tools  
- Package managers  
- Desktop environments (optional)  
- Pre-installed applications  

Each distribution customizes Linux for different **purposes**, **users**, and **hardware** types.

## Why So Many Distros?

Because **Linux is open-source**, anyone can modify, rebuild, and redistribute it.  
This flexibility allows distros to be tailored for:

- **Beginners** (user-friendly)  
- **Developers** (with dev tools)  
- **Servers** (optimized for performance)  
- **Security & hacking**  
- **Education or lightweight systems**

## Common Linux Distributions

| **Distribution** | **Based On** | **Description / Purpose** |
|------------------|--------------|----------------------------|
| **Ubuntu** | Debian | Most popular for desktops and servers; user-friendly and beginner-friendly. |
| **Debian** | Independent | Very stable and widely used as a base for other distros. |
| **Fedora** | Independent (sponsored by Red Hat) | Cutting-edge technology, often used for testing new features. |
| **CentOS / AlmaLinux / Rocky Linux** | RHEL | Server-focused distros used in production environments. |
| **Arch Linux** | Independent | Lightweight, minimal, and fully customizable (for advanced users). |
| **Manjaro** | Arch | Easier version of Arch with pre-configured tools. |
| **openSUSE** | Independent | Stable and enterprise-ready; includes YaST management tool. |
| **Kali Linux** | Debian | Designed for penetration testing and cybersecurity. |
| **Linux Mint** | Ubuntu | Simple, elegant, and similar to Windows (great for beginners). |
| **Pop!_OS** | Ubuntu | Optimized for developers and creators. |
