# Ubuntu (Linux) Folder Structure

## Overview

In Linux (including Ubuntu), **everything is organized under the root directory `/`** â€” called the **root filesystem**.  
Every file, directory, and device starts from `/`.

Below is the **hierarchy of common directories** and their purposes ðŸ‘‡  

## Main Directories in Ubuntu

| **Directory** | **Description** |
|----------------|-----------------|
| **`/`** | The **root directory** â€” top of the Linux filesystem hierarchy. All other directories and files exist under it. |
| **`/bin`** | Contains **essential user commands** (binaries) like `ls`, `cp`, `mv`, `cat`, and `bash`. Used by both root and normal users. |
| **`/boot`** | Contains **bootloader files**, **Linux kernel**, and boot configuration files (e.g., `vmlinuz`, `grub`). |
| **`/dev`** | Stores **device files** (representing hardware) like disks (`/dev/sda`), terminals, and USB devices. |
| **`/etc`** | Holds **system-wide configuration files** (e.g., `/etc/passwd`, `/etc/hostname`, `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`). |
| **`/home`** | Contains **personal user directories** (e.g., `/home/fahad`). Each user stores personal files, downloads, and configs here. |
| **`/lib`** | Stores **shared libraries** needed by programs in `/bin` and `/sbin`. Similar to `.dll` files in Windows. |
| **`/media`** | Temporary mount point for **external devices** (USB, CD-ROM, etc.) when plugged in. |
| **`/mnt`** | Traditionally used to **manually mount** filesystems (like another partition or network drive). |
| **`/opt`** | Optional software packages (third-party apps) installed outside of the default system structure. |
| **`/proc`** | Virtual filesystem containing **runtime system information** â€” like processes and kernel data (`/proc/cpuinfo`, `/proc/meminfo`). |
| **`/root`** | Home directory for the **root (admin) user**. |
| **`/run`** | Contains **temporary runtime data** (e.g., PID files, sockets). Cleared on every reboot. |
| **`/sbin`** | Contains **system administration binaries** like `reboot`, `fdisk`, `ifconfig`. Usually requires root access. |
| **`/srv`** | Holds **data served by system services**, like web or FTP server content. |
| **`/sys`** | Virtual filesystem providing access to **kernel and device information**. |
| **`/tmp`** | Temporary directory for **short-lived files**. Automatically cleared on reboot. |
| **`/usr`** | Contains **user programs and data** â€” e.g., `/usr/bin`, `/usr/lib`, `/usr/share`. Most installed software lives here. |
| **`/var`** | Stores **variable data** that changes frequently â€” like logs, mail, caches, and databases (`/var/log`, `/var/mail`). |

## In Short

> The **Ubuntu filesystem** follows a **hierarchical structure** starting from `/` (root).  
> Each directory has a **specific purpose** â€” from configuration (`/etc`) and user data (`/home`) to logs (`/var`) and system binaries (`/bin`).
